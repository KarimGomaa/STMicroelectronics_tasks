## üåü Project Overview

This project involves developing a custom shell in C. The shell handles internal, external, and unsupported commands, offering a basic yet functional command-line interface for user interaction.

### üìö Libraries Used

- `#include <stdio.h>`
- `#include <string.h>`
- `#include <stdlib.h>`
- `#include <unistd.h>`
- `#include <sys/types.h>`
- `#include <sys/stat.h>`
- `#include <fcntl.h>`
- `#include <sys/wait.h>`

To understand the usage and functions provided by these libraries, Just read the man pages that would be provided in the man section.

## üéØ Features
- **Internal Commands**: Built-in commands implemented directly within the shell use help in shell to know these commands.
- **External Commands**: Commands found in the enivroment variable locations.
- **Unsupported Commands**: Commands that are not supported by the shell.


## üöÄ Installation & Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
1. **Compile the Shell**
   ```bash
   gcc -o shell shell_cont.c
1. **Run the Shell**
   ```bash   
   ./shell

## üõ†Ô∏è Internal Commands
These commands are implemented directly within the shell and include:

- `cd`: Change the current directory.
- `mypwd`: Display the current working directory.
- `myecho`: Print the given arguments to the terminal.
- `help`: Display help information about the shell's built-in commands.
- `exit`: Exit the shell.
- `type`: Indicate how a command would be interpreted (e.g., internal, external, or unsupported).
- `mycp`: Copy files from one location to another.
- `mymv`: Move or rename files.
- `envir`: Display all environment variables.
- `envir variable`: Set or display a specific environment variable.
- `phist`: Show the history of the last 10 commands executed in the shell.


## üîß External Commands

The shell can execute any external command available in the system's environment PATH Using its Name. Some common examples include:

- `ls`: List directory contents.
- `grep`: Search for patterns in files.
- `cat`: Concatenate and display file contents.
- `mkdir`: Create a new directory.
- `rm`: Remove files or directories.
- `cp`: Copy files or directories.
- `mv`: Move or rename files or directories.
- `echo`: Display a line of text or a string.
- `ps`: Report a snapshot of current processes.
- `top`: Display Linux tasks.

These external commands are executed by spawning child processes, allowing the shell to leverage the existing utilities provided by the operating system.

## üö´ Unsupported Commands

The shell currently does not support any applications beyond the internal and external commands listed above. Specifically:

- **Bash Space Command**: The shell does not support the use of spaces in command paths. Any file or directory paths should not contain spaces.
- **File Paths with Spaces**: Commands requiring file paths must have paths without spaces. For example, `/path/to/file` is supported, but `/path/to/space in name` is not.
- **Options for `mycp` and `mymv`**: The custom `mycp` and `mymv` commands do not support options. They should be used simply as `mycp sourcepath destinationpath` and `mymv sourcepath destinationpath`, with both paths being free of spaces.
- **External Command Full Paths**: The shell works only with external command names found in the system's PATH environment variable. It does not support executing external commands using their full file paths. For example, the shell can execute `ls`, but not `/usr/bin/ls`.

These limitations are acknowledged, and we plan to address them in future implementations to provide more comprehensive support.

## üìñ Manuals

The program makes use of various system calls and functions to implement the commands. Here are the relevant manual commands used:

- `man 2 open`: Used for opening files.
- `man getcwd`: Used to get the current working directory.
- `man read`: Used for reading from files.
- `man 2 write`: Used for writing to files.
- `man 2 stat`: Used for obtaining information about files.
- `man remove`: Used for removing files.
- `man envir`: Used for handling environment variables.
- `man chdir`: Used for changing the current working directory.
- `man getenv`: Used for retrieving environment variable values.
- `man access`: Used for checking user's permissions for a file.
- `man exec`: Used for executing programs.
- `man waitpid`: Used for waiting for state changes in a child process.

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Details

The implementation of the custom shell involves various functions, each handling specific tasks related to command execution and shell behavior. Below is a list of functions and global variable used in the implementation :

### Functions used:
- `add_process`: Manages process addition to the shell's internal data structures to be used in phist command.
- `fun_PHIST`: Handles the display of the last 10 processes occured and it displays the pid and exit status.
- `is_internal_command`: Checks if a given command is an internal command to be used in main and type command.
- `is_external_command`: Checks if a given command is an external commandto be used in main and type command.
- `fun_TYPE`: Determines the type of a command (internal, external, unsupported).
- `remove_newline`: Removes newline characters from a string used after read input_string in main.
- `REMOVE_LeadingSpaces`: Removes leading spaces from a string used after remove_newline in main .
- `fun_PWD`: Implements the `mypwd` command to display the current directory.
- `fun_HELP`: Provides help information for shell commands.
- `fun_ECHO`: Implements the `myecho` command to print arguments.
- `fun_COPY`: Handles the `mycp` command for copying files.
- `fun_MOVE`: Implements the `mymv` command for moving/renaming files.
- `fun_CD`: Changes the current directory (`cd` command).
- `fun_ENVIR`: Displays environment variables (`envir` command).
- `fun_ENVIR_VARIABLE`: Sets or displays a specific environment variable.
- `fun_EXTERNAL_COMMAND`: Executes external commands found in the PATH.
- `fun_SHELL_WRITE`: Handles writing output to the shell.

### Main Function Overview

The `main` function is the entry point of the custom shell program. It contains the main loop that continuously prompts the user for input, processes commands, and executes the appropriate functions.

### How the Main Function Works

1. **Initialization and Loop Start**:
   - The shell starts by initializing necessary variables, including `token` for command separation and `input_string_main_copy` for safely copying the input string.
   - It enters an infinite loop (`while(1)`) to continuously prompt the user for commands.

2. **Prompt and Read Input**:
   - The function `fun_SHELL_WRITE()` is called to display the shell prompt.
   - It then reads user input from the standard input using `read(STDIN, input_string, INPUT_BUFFER)`.
   - Leading spaces are removed from the input string with `REMOVE_LeadingSpaces(input_string)`, and newlines are removed with `remove_newline(input_string)`.

3. **Command Tokenization**:
   - The input string is copied to `input_string_main_copy` to prevent modifications.
   - The first token (command) is extracted using `strtok(input_string_main_copy, " ")`.

4. **Command Handling**:
   - **Internal Commands**: The program checks if the command is internal using `is_internal_command(token)`.
     - It handles various internal commands such as `help`, `mypwd`, `myecho`, `exit`, `mycp`, `mymv`, `cd`, `type`, `envir`, `envir variable`, and `phist`. For each command, the corresponding function is called (e.g., `fun_HELP()` for `help`).
   - **External Commands**: If the command is not internal, it checks if it's an external command with `is_external_command(token)`. If so, `fun_EXTERNAL_COMMAND()` is called to execute it.
   - **Invalid Commands**: If the command is neither internal nor external, it prompts the user to enter a valid command.

5. **Exit Condition**:
   - The loop continues indefinitely until the user enters the `exit` command, which breaks the loop and terminates the shell.

### Global Variables and Structures:

The shell program uses several global variables and structures to manage state and functionality. Here‚Äôs an explanation of each:

- `char input_string[INPUT_BUFFER];`
  - This global variable stores the input command from the user. It is used across multiple functions to access and manipulate the command entered.

- `char pwd_PATH[PWD_BUFFER];`
  - This variable stores the current working directory path. It is used in commands like `mypwd` to display the directory.

- `extern char** environ;`
  - This variable provides access to the environment variables for the current process. It is used in the `envir` function to display or manipulate environment variables.

- `const char *internal_commands[] = {"cd", "mypwd", "myecho", "help", "exit", "type", "mycp", "mymv", "envir", "envir variable", "phist", NULL};`
  - This array lists all the internal commands supported by the shell. It is used to check if a command is internal and to execute the corresponding function.

- `typedef struct { pid_t pid; int exit_status; } ProcessInfo;`
  - This structure is used to store information about processes. It includes:
    - `pid`: The process ID.
    - `exit_status`: The exit status of the process.

- `ProcessInfo process_history[MAX_HISTORY];`
  - This global array stores the history of processes that have been executed. It keeps track of process IDs and their exit statuses up to a maximum number defined by `MAX_HISTORY`.

- `int process_count = 0;`
  - This integer keeps track of the number of processes that have been added to `process_history`. It starts from 0 and increments as processes are tracked.

These global variables and structures are essential for the shell's operation, allowing it to handle user input, track the current directory, manage environment variables, execute internal commands, and maintain a history of processes.

## Conclusion

This custom shell program demonstrates the implementation of a simple command-line interpreter with a variety of internal and external commands. The project serves as a practical exploration of system programming concepts, including process management, command parsing, and handling of environment variables.

While the current version provides basic functionality, there are areas for future improvement and expansion. The shell could be enhanced to support more complex command syntax, better error handling, and additional internal commands. We also plan to address the current limitations, such as handling of file paths with spaces and supporting command options for `mycp` and `mymv`.

We hope this project serves as a valuable learning experience and a foundation for further exploration in the field of system programming.
