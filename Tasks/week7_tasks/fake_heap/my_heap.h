/*
 * Description:
 * 1. Allocates a block of memory of the specified size from the custom heap.
 * 2. If the heap is empty (i.e., this is the first allocation), it initializes the heap with the allocated block and sets up the first free block immediately after it.
 * 3. If the heap is not empty, it searches through the list of free blocks to find a suitable block that can accommodate the requested size.
 * 4. If a suitable block is found:
 *    - It adjusts the size of the block and potentially splits it if there is leftover space.
 *    - Updates the metadata for the free list to maintain consistency.
 * 5. If no suitable block is found, it extends the heap if there is enough space and adjusts the free block list accordingly.
 * 6. Returns a pointer to the start of the allocated memory block, which is offset from the metadata.
 * 7. If allocation fails (e.g., due to insufficient memory), it returns `NULL`.
 *
 * Parameters:
 * - `size`: The size of the memory block to allocate, in bytes.
 *
 * Return Value:
 * - Returns a pointer to the allocated memory block, or `NULL` if the allocation fails.

/*
 * Description:
 * 1. Frees a previously allocated block of memory, making it available for future allocations.
 * 2. Checks if the provided pointer is `NULL`. If so, it prints an error message and returns without performing any operations.
 * 3. Calculates the metadata pointer for the block to be freed based on the given pointer.
 * 4. Handles the case where the free list is empty by initializing it with the freed block.
 * 5. If the free list is not empty:
 *    - Traverses the list to find the appropriate position for the freed block.
 *    - Inserts the freed block into the correct position in the free list while maintaining proper pointers.
 * 6. Merges adjacent free blocks if necessary, updating the metadata to reflect the new size of the combined free space.
 * 7. Calls an auxiliary function to update the free spaces list, ensuring the heapâ€™s free memory is accurately represented.
 *
 * Parameters:
 * - `ptr`: A pointer to the memory block to be freed. This pointer should have been previously allocated using `HmmAlloc`.
 *
 * Return Value:
 * - This function does not return a value. It performs operations to free memory and update the free list.

/*
 * Description:
 *   Custom implementation of calloc that allocates memory for an array and initializes all bytes to zero.
 *   The function aligns the total memory size to 8 bytes for better performance on some architectures.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   - num_elements: The number of elements to allocate memory for.
 *   - size_of_each_element: The size of each element in bytes.
 *
 * Returns:
 *   - A pointer to the allocated memory if successful.
 *   - NULL if memory allocation fails.

/*
 * Description:
 *   Custom implementation of realloc that reallocates a memory block to a new size.
 *   If the new size is larger, it copies the existing data to the newly allocated memory.
 *   If the pointer is NULL, it behaves like malloc.
 *   If the size is 0, it frees the memory.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   - ptr: The pointer to the previously allocated memory block.
 *   - size: The new size in bytes for the memory block.
 *
 * Returns:
 *   - A pointer to the newly allocated memory block if successful.
 *   - NULL if memory allocation fails or if size is 0 and ptr is not NULL.
