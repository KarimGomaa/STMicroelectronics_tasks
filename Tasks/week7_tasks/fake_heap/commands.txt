There is Makefile that provides several options for compiling my_heap in different configurations:

#### make #### Compiles the program along with a stress test, including debugging options for easier troubleshooting and analysis.

#### make release #### Compiles the program with a stress test, but without debugging options, making it suitable for production or deployment.

#### make shared #### Compiles my_heap as a shared library with debugging options enabled, useful for development and debugging purposes.

#### make sharedrelease #### Compiles my_heap as a shared library without debugging options, suitable for use in production environments.

#### make clean #### to remove the compiled files

To use my_heap as the heap implementation instead of the standard one when compiling with a shared library, you can use the following command after compilation:

LD_PRELOAD=`realpath libhmm.so` ls
