## üåü Project Overview

This project involves developing a custom heap in C, and it consists of several primary files and folders: `my_heap.c`, `my_heap.h`, `std_types.h`, `stress_test`, and a `Makefile`. Additionally, the project is organized into two folders: `fake_heap` and `real_heap`. Below is a detailed explanation of each component and their key features.

### Folders

The heap implementation is organized into two main folders:

- **`fake_heap`**: This folder simulates the heap using a pre-allocated 200 MB array. It is primarily used for testing purposes, where memory allocation and deallocation do not directly affect the system's memory.

- **`real_heap`**: This folder contains the real implementation of the heap, utilizing the `sbrk` system call to request memory directly from the operating system. The `real_heap` version interacts directly with the system's memory, making it suitable for realistic and production-level testing. 

In this implementation, the program break is carefully managed to optimize memory usage. If a large amount of free memory is detected, the program break is decreased to avoid consuming unnecessary heap space. This dynamic adjustment helps maintain efficient memory allocation and prevents excessive memory usage by releasing unused memory back to the operating system when possible.


### Files and Key Components

## üõ† How it Works ?

Heap memory is a region of a computer's memory that is used for dynamic memory allocation. Unlike stack memory, which is managed automatically, heap memory must be manually allocated and freed by the programmer. The heap allows for flexible and efficient management of memory at runtime, which is essential for applications that require dynamic memory usage.

### How Heap Memory Works

1. **Dynamic Allocation:** When a program needs memory at runtime, it requests a block of memory from the heap. This is typically done using functions like `malloc` in C or `new` in C++ or `HmmAlloc` in My Heap ^_^ .
   
2. **Allocation Strategies:** The heap uses various algorithms to manage memory allocation. Common strategies include:
   - **First Fit:** Allocates the first block of sufficient size.
   - **Best Fit:** Allocates the smallest block that fits the request.
   - **Worst Fit:** Allocates the largest available block.
   
We are going to deal with First fit that Allocates the first block of sufficient size.
   
3. **Memory Fragmentation:** Over time, as memory is allocated and freed, the heap can become fragmented, leading to inefficient use of memory and increased allocation times.

4. **Freeing Memory:** It is crucial to free allocated memory when it is no longer needed to avoid memory leaks and other issues.

## üîß `HmmAlloc`

- **Purpose:** This function is responsible for allocating a specified amount of memory.

- **Parameters:**
  - `size`: `uint64` - The size of the memory allocation in bytes.

- **Operation:**
  - This function allocates a block of memory of the given size and returns a pointer to the start of the allocated block. If the allocation fails, it returns a null pointer.

- **Return Value:**
  - Returns a pointer to the allocated memory block, or `NULL` if the allocation fails.

## ‚öôÔ∏è `HmmFree`

The `HmmFree` function is responsible for releasing previously allocated memory and merging adjacent free memory blocks. Here‚Äôs a detailed description of its operation:

### Functionality

1. **Locate Free Pointer:**
   - The function begins by identifying the position of the memory block to be freed. It uses a loop to find the correct location and checks if the pointer is `NULL`. If the pointer is `NULL`, the function returns immediately with a message indicating that there is nothing to free.

2. **Update Metadata:**
   - Upon locating the pointer, the function updates the metadata. The metadata size is adjusted to account for the size of the freed memory block. This is necessary because our implementation maintains free spaces with full metadata, while allocated pointers only store the size without metadata. Therefore, we extend the metadata to include the size of the newly freed block.

3. **Merge Adjacent Free Blocks:**
   - After updating the metadata, the function enters a loop to consolidate adjacent free memory blocks. This involves merging contiguous free spaces into a single larger block, which optimizes memory usage and improves allocation efficiency.

### Summary

In summary, `HmmFree` effectively manages memory by:

- Identifying the position of the free pointer.
- Handling cases where the pointer is `NULL`.
- Updating metadata to reflect the newly freed space.
- Merging adjacent free memory blocks into a unified block.

This approach ensures efficient memory management and reduces fragmentation in the heap.

## ‚öôÔ∏è `HmmCalloc`

The `HmmCalloc` function is responsible for allocating memory for an array of elements and initializing all bytes to zero. This function ensures that the allocated memory is aligned and efficiently managed for performance.

### Functionality

1. **Calculate Total Size:**
   - The function calculates the total size required for the allocation by multiplying the number of elements (`num_elements`) by the size of each element (`size_of_each_element`).

2. **Align Memory Size:**
   - The total memory size is aligned to 8 bytes for optimal performance on some architectures. If the calculated size is zero, it is set to 8 to ensure a small memory block is allocated, which can be freed later.

3. **Allocate Memory:**
   - Memory is allocated using the custom `HmmAlloc` function. If the allocation fails, the function returns `NULL`.

4. **Initialize Memory to Zero:**
   - The allocated memory is initialized to zero to ensure it is clean and ready for use.

5. **Return Allocated Pointer:**
   - The function returns a pointer to the allocated memory, which is initialized to zero.

### Summary

In summary, `HmmCalloc` provides a way to allocate zero-initialized memory for an array of elements. It ensures the memory is aligned to 8 bytes, which improves performance and memory management efficiency.

## ‚öôÔ∏è `HmmRealloc`

The `HmmRealloc` function is responsible for reallocating a memory block to a new size. It can handle cases where the memory needs to be expanded or reduced, and it manages the associated data copying as needed.

### Functionality

1. **Handle `NULL` Pointer:**
   - If the input pointer (`ptr`) is `NULL`, `HmmRealloc` behaves like `HmmAlloc` and allocates a new memory block of the specified size.

2. **Free Memory if Size is Zero:**
   - If the requested size is zero, the function frees the memory block pointed to by `ptr` and returns `NULL`.

3. **Align New Size:**
   - The requested size is aligned to 8 bytes for optimal memory alignment, ensuring efficient memory management.

4. **Allocate New Memory:**
   - A new memory block of the aligned size is allocated using `HmmAlloc`.

5. **Copy Existing Data:**
   - The function copies the data from the old memory block to the new one. It determines the number of bytes to copy by taking the smaller of the old size and the new size.

6. **Free Old Memory:**
   - The old memory block is freed after its data has been copied to the new block.

7. **Return New Memory Pointer:**
   - The function returns a pointer to the newly allocated memory block.

### Summary

In summary, `HmmRealloc` provides a flexible way to adjust the size of a memory allocation. It handles all necessary operations, including allocation, deallocation, data copying, and size alignment, making it a versatile tool for dynamic memory management.


## üîßüß™ Testing my_heap

#### First we tested my_heap in a stress_test with 100,000 Allocs and free.
![testing1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99037d23-e19d-4404-97d4-f1187d15ab2a)

#### Second we want to see my_heap with gdb to see the list of free allocs and it's next and prev pointers
![testing2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8154c64f-d38a-48e3-94ec-be4d27e736d0)

#### In the middle of the program and we notice that my_heap is preforming well all next and prev pointers are correct
![testing3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cc7c01f-5513-4f0a-b32e-4ec384879e6a)

#### As expected from the stress_test.c at the end it will free all allocs so we have only one free block with the size of the all mallocs and extended program break.
